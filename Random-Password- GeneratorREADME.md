🔐 PyPassword Generator

A simple and secure Random Password Generator built using Python! This project helps users create strong passwords with a mix of letters, symbols, and numbers, making it easy to protect accounts and information from potential security threats.

🌟 Purpose

The PyPassword Generator enables users to generate highly secure, randomized passwords. Passwords can be customized to include a specified number of letters, symbols, and numbers. By using a strong password, users enhance their security for online accounts, digital documents, and other sensitive information.

🔧 Technologies Used

-Python: The primary programming language used.
-Random Module: Utilized to randomize character selection and shuffle the final password for added security.

🛠️ How It Works

1. The user specifies the number of letters, symbols, and numbers they’d like in their password.
2. The program then selects characters randomly and combines them into a unique password.
3. The final password is shuffled and displayed, ensuring randomness and security.
   
🚀 Impact

With increasing online security threats, using strong passwords has become essential.
