PyPassword Generator

Welcome to the PyPassword Generator! This project is a simple Python-based solution designed to help users quickly generate secure passwords with customizable letters, symbols, and numbers.

Project Purpose
The goal of this project is to create strong and unpredictable passwords that enhance online security by preventing unauthorized access. Users can define the number of characters, symbols, and numbers they want in their password, and the generator will create a randomized password meeting those criteria.

Features
Customizable password length with user-defined letters, numbers, and symbols.
High randomness for stronger, more secure passwords.
Quick and easy to use, running directly from the command line.

Technology
Python: This project is written entirely in Python, utilizing libraries such as random for generating and shuffling the password components.

How It Works
The user specifies the desired number of letters, symbols, and numbers.
The program randomly selects characters from pre-defined lists of letters, symbols, and numbers.
The password components are shuffled and combined into a single, strong password that the user can then use as needed.

Impact
Online security is increasingly important in a digital world, and strong passwords are a vital first step in protecting personal and professional accounts. This tool allows users to easily create strong, random passwords, reducing the risk of breaches and enhancing privacy.

Happy secure browsing!
